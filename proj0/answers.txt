Project 0 questions:
1. I started by setting up the virtual machine Qemu in the sandbox folder on a CSIL machine. I then downloaded the Minix ISO image and followed the instructions for booting Minix on Qemu on this website: http://wiki.minix3.org/UsersGuide/RunningOnQemu. Once it was booted up, I ran setup on Minix, where I selected keyboard type, partions, disks, block sizes, and Ethernet chip, all of which I kept as the default suggested values. I then rebooted Minix with my new selections. Then, I continued following the instructions on the website to set up virtualized disk and network drivers. I then installed the openssh package and the rsyn package, and set up everything I need for rsync to work.

2. Minix comes with and ast user becuase it contains all the default files for a user, so that when you create a new user, the contents of /usr/ast are copied into that user's new home directory. So, if you want to have specific defaulst set up for created users, you just have to edit the ast files.

3. The Minix application that you use to install new software is called pkgin.

4. In order to rebuild the kernel and install it, you must run the following two commands:
# cd /usr/src/releasetools
# make hdboot

5. The kernel source file that hold the Minix banner string is /usr/src/kernel/main.c

6. The name of the Minix system call with the number 33 is do_access. This information is stored in /usr/src/servers/fs/table.c
